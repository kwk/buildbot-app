## This step might look counter intuitive at first but it has a reason.
## I make heavy use of a the asciidoc include directive to keep the document
## as close to the truth as possible.
## Sometimes I include complete files and sometimes just tagged regions or
## in the worst case, just lines by line number. Unfortunately github doesn't
## allow includes at all. That's why I convert my asciidoc document
## to docbook only to convert it back to asciidoc but this time with
## materialized include files.
