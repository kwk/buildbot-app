Let's build an app that lets you control your buildbot through `/buildbot` comments on Github Pull Requests.

== Developer Setup

I'm using a Fedora Linux 37 on my local machine and for most of the containers.

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/kwk/buildbot-app.git && cd buildbot-app # <1>
$ sudo dnf install -y direnv golang podman podman-compose buildbot pandic asciidoctor # <2>
$ go install github.com/cespare/reflex@latest # <3>
$ cat <<EOF >> ~/.bashrc # <4>
export PATH=\${PATH}:~/go/bin
eval "\$(direnv hook bash)"
EOF
$ source ~/.bashrc # <5>
$ direnv allow . # <6>
$ make infra-start # <7>
$ make app # <8>
----
<1> Clone the repo.
<2> Install tools we need/use for development locally. If this was a deployment site the only requirement is buildbot so that the github app can make a call to `buildbot try`.
<3> Install hot-reload tool.
<4> Make tools above available upon next source of `.bashrc`.
<5> Reload `.bashrc` to have `direnv` and `reflex` working in your current shell.
<6> Navgigate out and back into the project directory to have `direnv` kickin. If this doesn't work, try `direnv allow .`.
<7> Bring up local containers for a buildbot setup with one master and three workers.
<8> Run and hot reload the app code upon changes being made to any of your `*.go` files or your `.envrc` file.

== TODO

- [ ] properly document developer setup with ngrok and how to setup the `.envrc` file
- [ ] hook into buildbots event system and send feedback to buildbot app from there?
