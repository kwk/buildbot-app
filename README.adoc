Let’s build GitHub app that lets you control your buildbot through
`/buildbot` comments on GitHub Pull Requests.

[[_scenarios]]
== Scenarios

This section lists the ideas and sometimes even fully implemented
scenarios we have for this GitHub app.

[[_comment_buildbot_on_pull_request]]
=== Comment `/buildbot` on Pull Request

In this scenario a user authors a Pull Request comment with the comment
body being `/buildbot`.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwk/buildbot-app/main/docs/media/screenshots/author-buildbot-comment.png[author
buildbot comment]

The `buildbot-app` gets notified about a new comment and checks if it
matches a regular expression. In this case the pattern is `^/buildbot$`
but it could be much more complex and equipped with arguments, depending
on the semantics we want to establish. For the purpose of this
demonstration, `/buildbot` is simply enough.

Internally a command comment will be converted into this structure:

*Command structure (../cmd/buildbot-app/command/command.go)*

[source,go]
----
// A Command represents all information about a /buildbot command
type Command struct {
    // When true, the command has to pass for the PR in order pass gating
    // (default: true).
    IsMandatory bool
    // Case-sensitive, sorted list of builders without duplicates to run build on.
    // TODO(kwk): Maybe we can default to something reasonable here?
    BuilderNames []string
    // The user's GitHub login that issued the /buildbot comment
    CommentAuthor string
    // When true, we'll try to run the build even if the PR has already been
    // tested at this stage (default: false).
    Force bool
}
----

There’s a regular expression that a string comment must match (see
`StringIsCommand()`) in order for it to be a valid command string:

*Regular Rexpression (cmd/buildbot-app/command/command.go)*

[source,go]
----
const (
    // BuildbotCommand is the command that triggers the buildbot workflow in a
    // GitHub comment.
    BuildbotCommand = "/buildbot"

    // CommandOptionMandatory is the boolean option to make a check run
    // mandatory.
    CommandOptionMandatory = "mandatory"

    // CommandOptionBuilder is the option that can be used multiple times in a
    // command comment. The resulting builders will be a case-sensitive, sorted
    // list of builders with no duplicates.
    CommandOptionBuilder = "builder"

    // CommandOptionForce is the boolean option to enforce a new build even if
    // one is already present.
    CommandOptionForce = "force"
)

// StringIsCommand returns true if the given string is a valid /buildbot command.
func StringIsCommand(s string) bool {
    // force=yes|no : Can be used to allow for PRs to be build even when
    // they are closed or when a check run for the exact same SHA has been
    // run already.
    return regexp.MustCompile(buildRegexPattern()).MatchString(s)
}

// buildRegexPattern returns the regex pattern to match a string against a
// /buildbot command
func buildRegexPattern() string {
    tfOptions := `(yes|no|true|false|f|t|y|n|0|1)`
    mandatoryOption := fmt.Sprintf(`%s=%s`, CommandOptionMandatory, tfOptions)
    forceOption := fmt.Sprintf(`%s=%s`, CommandOptionForce, tfOptions)
    builderOption := fmt.Sprintf(`%s=(\w+)`, CommandOptionBuilder)
    return fmt.Sprintf(`^%s(\s+|%s|%s|%s)*$`, BuildbotCommand, mandatoryOption, forceOption, builderOption)
}
----

[[_build_log_comment]]
==== Build Log Comment

The `buildbot-app` then creates a *Thank-you*-comment that serves two
purposes:

[arabic]
. It shows the user that we understood the request and are thankful for
it and that we are working on it.
. It is a perfect placeholder to store short build state changes for
future lookups. That is why we call this comment the
*build-log-comment*.
+
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwk/buildbot-app/main/media/screenshots/build-log-comment.png[build
log comment]
+
Just imagine, your PR gets updated and you want to see the previous
build results. The _build-log-comment_ is there for you too look it up.

The code for creating the comment is straight-forward:

*Thank You! (cmd/buildbot-app/on_issue_comment_event.go)*

[source,go]
----
     // This comment will be used all over the place
        thankYouComment := fmt.Sprintf(
            `Thank you @%s for using the <a href="todo:link-to-documentation-here"><code>%s</code></a> command <a href="%s">here</a>! `,
            command.BuildbotCommand,
            *event.Comment.User.Login,
            *event.Comment.HTMLURL,
        )

        newComment, _, err := gh.Issues.CreateComment(context.Background(), repoOwner, repoName, prNumber, &github.IssueComment{
            Body: github.String(thankYouComment +
                `<sub>This very comment will be used to continously log build state changes for your request. We decided to do this in addition to using Github's Check Runs below so you can inspect previous check runs better.</sub>`,
            ),
        })
----

[[_check_run]]
==== Check run

Of course, we are also using GitHub’s check runs as you can see here:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwk/buildbot-app/main/media/screenshots/check-run-overview.png[check
run overview]

[NOTE]
====
I really like that we can dynamically create check runs on request and
give them good names.
====

When you click on *Details* next to a check run, you’re brought to this
page on GitHub:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwk/buildbot-app/main/media/screenshots/check-run-details.png[check
run details]

[[_video_walkthrough]]
==== Video walkthrough

We walk you through the creation of a Pull Request and authoring the
`/buildbot` comment in this in this short video:

[[_uml_sequence_diagram]]
==== UML sequence diagram

The sequence diagram for this scenario is layed out here. It includes
some of the internals of the processing.

[[_testing]]
=== Testing

[[_testing_github_interaction]]
==== Testing GitHub interaction

We’re using a fantastic library to run to simulate sequential GitHub
interaction: https://github.com/migueleliasweb/go-github-mock.

For example, when `/buildbot` comment is authored on a pull request we
don’t want a build to run if the pull request is not mergable. Therefore
we first have to take the event input and get the pull request from
GitHub before we check if is mergable:

*Get PR and check mergability
(cmd/buildbot-app/on_issue_comment_event.go)*

[source,go]
----
     commentUser := *event.Comment.User.Login
        repoOwner := *event.Repo.Owner.Login
        repoName := *event.Repo.Name
        prNumber := *event.Issue.Number
        pr, _, err := gh.PullRequests.Get(context.Background(), repoOwner, repoName, prNumber)
        if !pr.GetMergeable() {
        }
----

In order to test that a PR is not mergable, we can simply create a valid
`github.PullRequest` object (see `prOK()`) and set the `Mergable` member
to `false`. The mock server will return it as the first request and
afterwards create a `POST` a comment about the pull request not being
mergable:

*Test: Get PR and check mergability
(cmd/buildbot-app/on_issue_comment_event_test.go)*

[source,go]
----
func TestOnIssueCommentEventAny(t *testing.T) {
    t.Run("pr not mergable", func(t *testing.T) {
        t.Run("comment writable", func(t *testing.T) {
            prNotMergable := prOK()
            prNotMergable.Mergeable = github.Bool(false)
            srv := NewMockServer(
                // Get PR for comment event
                mock.WithRequestMatch(
                    mock.GetReposPullsByOwnerByRepoByPullNumber,
                    prNotMergable,
                ),
                // Create comment on about PR not being mergable
                mock.WithRequestMatch(
                    mock.PostReposIssuesCommentsByOwnerByRepoByIssueNumber,
                    github.IssueComment{
                        Body: github.String("blabla"),
                    },
                ),
            )
            fn := OnIssueCommentEventAny(srv)
            err := fn("1234", "created", issueCommentEventOK())
            require.ErrorContains(t, err, "pr is not mergable", "expected and error because pr is not mergable, yet")
        })
    })
}
----

For this trick to work we have to use dependency injection by passing a
Go interface (`Server`) instead of a real server object to functions in
various places:

*Server interface (cmd/buildbot-app/server.go)*

[source,go]
----
// Server specifies the interface that we need to implement from the AppServer
// object in order to provide a decent mock in tests.
type Server interface {

    // NewGithubClient returns a new GitHub client object for the given
    // application ID.
    NewGithubClient(appInstallationID int64) (*github.Client, error)

    // RunTryBot runs a "buildbot try" command
    RunTryBot(responsibleGithubLogin string, githubRepoOwner string, githubRepoName string, properties ...string) (string, error)
}
----

[[_todos]]
==== TODOs

* ❏ Reset check run to neutral after Pull Request was updated.
* ❏ Deal with buttons shown at the top of check run details page.

[[_developer_setup]]
== Developer Setup

I’m using a Fedora Linux 37 on my local machine and for most of the
containers.

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/kwk/buildbot-app.git && cd buildbot-app 
$ sudo dnf install -y direnv golang podman podman-compose buildbot pandic asciidoctor 
$ gem install asciidoctor-lists 
$ go install github.com/cespare/reflex@latest 
$ cat <<EOF >> ~/.bashrc 
export PATH=\${PATH}:~/go/bin
eval "\$(direnv hook bash)"
EOF
$ source ~/.bashrc 
$ direnv allow . 
$ make infra-start 
$ make app 
----

* Clone the repo.
* Install tools we need/use for development locally. If this was a
deployment site the only requirement is buildbot so that the github app
can make a call to `buildbot try`.
* Install extension to create list of figures etc.
* Install hot-reload tool.
* Make tools above available upon next source of `.bashrc`.
* Reload `.bashrc` to have `direnv` and `reflex` working in your current
shell.
* Navgigate out and back into the project directory to have `direnv`
kickin. If this doesn’t work, try `direnv allow .`.
* Bring up local containers for a buildbot setup with one master and
three workers.
* Run and hot reload the app code upon changes being made to any of your
`*.go` files or your `.envrc` file.
